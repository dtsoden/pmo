    <h1>Privacy Policy for PMO Time Tracker Extension</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 29, 2024</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>PMO Time Tracker is a Chrome extension designed to work with self-hosted installations of the PMO Platform application. This extension is <strong>open-source software</strong> that organizations download, install, and host on their own infrastructure.</p>

    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>The extension developer does NOT collect, store, or have access to any user data.</strong>
    </div>

    <h2>Developer Data Collection</h2>
    <p>This extension communicates exclusively with PMO Platform instances that are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hosted by the installing organization on their own servers</li>
        <li>Configured by the end user during extension setup</li>
        <li>Controlled entirely by the organization, not the developer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Handled by the Extension</h2>
    <p>When you use this extension, the following data is processed <strong>locally on your device and transmitted only to your organization's self-hosted PMO Platform backend</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication tokens:</strong> JWT tokens for maintaining your session with your organization's PMO Platform</li>
        <li><strong>User profile information:</strong> Your name, email, and role as stored in your organization's PMO Platform</li>
        <li><strong>Timer data:</strong> Project/task assignments and time tracking entries you create</li>
        <li><strong>Timer shortcuts:</strong> Quick-start buttons you configure for frequently used projects</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All of this data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's local storage API</li>
        <li>Is transmitted ONLY to the PMO Platform API URL you configure</li>
        <li>Is controlled by your organization's PMO Platform administrators</li>
        <li>Is NEVER sent to the extension developer or any third party</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Organization's Responsibility</h2>
    <p>Because PMO Platform is self-hosted software, <strong>your organization</strong> controls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>What data is collected and stored</li>
        <li>Where that data is hosted</li>
        <li>Who has access to that data</li>
        <li>How long that data is retained</li>
        <li>Compliance with applicable privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For questions about how your data is handled, contact your organization's PMO Platform administrators.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>This extension does NOT use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. It does not communicate with any servers except the PMO Platform backend URL you configure.</p>
